# JFK-Taxi-Out-time-prediction-model
In this assignment we were exploring airport data to see which data affects Taxi Out time for aeroplanes in JFK airport.
Using linear regression we then predicted future Taxi Out time using our model and then tested the accuracy of the model.
In conclusion, we saw that there was no correlation between any of the data significantly on Taxi Out time.
However if I had continued working to improve the pediction model, I would explore more into using 'Weather Conditions' 
as that seems highly likely to affect Taxi Out times as well as delays from aeroplanes ahead waiting to be cleared for 
takeoff.
